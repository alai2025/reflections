When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are collaborating with other people. By putting it in github, other people can access your branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes you may not want the master since the master may have bugs, or you could be experimenting on your remote, which would save time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks just contain an additional copy of the respository while clones actually receive all the code files to the local computer. When collaborating, you would fork since it is on github and not limited to your local computer. Cloning might be useful for saving backups or creating new copies to then modify. As a result, a branch is created and useful for experimentation. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
